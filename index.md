## HW0: Introduction
Hi, my name is Joe Mezera. I am a senior here at the College of Charelston. I hit global in wingman. I like cars, and computers, and going to in person classes.


## HW1: Chapter 1
1.3: What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four
other attributes that may sometimes be significant.
All software should be, dependable and secure, Efficient, Maintainable, and acceptable to the 
users(understandable, usable and compatible)
other attributes that may sometimes be significant are affordability, learnability, testability, portability.


1.8: Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or
lawyers.

Although software engineers do not often directly hold their clients lives in their hands like doctors or lawyers may, there is still often times sensitive information being handled. A software engineer has the responsibility to protect any information that their software may receive from anyone it is not intended to reach. They also have a responsibility to not misuse their skills to gain access to things that were meant to be sealed. As with any job dealing with peoples personal details, it is the responsibility of the person handling the information to make sure that it remains safe and a license it a good way to ensure that the person handling the information is indeed qualified to do so. 


1.9: For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an
appropriate example that illustrates that clause.

Public: Adding features that are requested by users
Client and employer: Creating functionalities requested by an employer that improve the environment for the client
product: Writing software that not only does what was requested, but is time and space efficient.
judgment: Refusing any work that they think is wronging or harmful to anyone. Refusing work that may be immoral. 
Management: Don't lie about experience or capabilities to potential clients, promote good morals within the software development team. 
profession: Advance yours and your teams skills by doing good work and promoting good software engineering practices. 
Colleagues: Promote healthy collaboration and make sure that the engineers are comfortable asking for help.
Self: Continuing to improve oneself from job to job and learning from those around you


1.10: To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer systems that
track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, this has privacy implications. Discuss
the ethics of working on the development of this type of system.

It is hard to weigh the value of privacy for the citizens of a country against the potential value of their safety. Spying on, or tracking citizens clearly violates their privacy regardless of whether or not their privacy is supposedly protected by law. It is also hard to evaluate how much poeple knowing they're being watched changes their behavior, and therefore it is hard to know the extent that citizens are potentially being protected by this invasion of privacy. The ethics of working on a system meant to protect the public that also invades their privacy would have to be evaluated by the individual asked to do the project. There is no right or wrong answer, assuming the software is being used as intended, and therefore the engineer needs to weigh the pros and cons and decide whether or not it goes against their own personal beleifs.
